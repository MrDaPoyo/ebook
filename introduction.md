# Brief introduction to the book

Howdy, internaut!
If you're reading this book, I assume you're a nostalgic fellow who also wants to build a website reminiscent of the 90s. However, you may have tried to build one, and have discovered that creating such beautiful pieces of art is challenging. Don't worry! That's why I'm here to help you. :D

In this book, I will teach you how to build your own website from scratch, what the trends were in the 1990s-2000s, and how we can replicate the looks of such websites.
We will also dive into the trends of the 1990s-2000s, they are essential to understanding how can we replicate them.
There were many trends back in the 90s, such as having your visitors sign a guestbook, visitor counters, and blinkies/buttons(More on that later), and believe it or not, <span style="color: green; font-family: 'Comic Sans', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">Comic Sans</span> was all the rage worldwide.
Yep O-O, Comic Sans. What the fu-
We'll also talk about how to create a button yourself, and how to join a webring. 
Without further ado, let's get started!
