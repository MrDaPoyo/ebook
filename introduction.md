# Brief history of web development in the early 1990s-2000s



If you're reading this book, I assume you're a nostalgic peep who also wants to build a website straight from the 90s, but, maybe you found out that it's tough to create one. That's why I'm here today to help you!

The good news is that you can truly be yourself when creating a website! Peeps don't make their websites to look professional, but to be as unique as possible. That means it doesn't have to look really great, it just has to be special. That's what makes every website of the old internet worth visiting.

There were many trends back in the 90s! Such as having your visitors sign a guestbook, visitor counters, and blinkies/buttons(More on that later), and believe it or not, <span style="color: green; font-family: 'Comic Sans', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">Comic Sans</span> was all the rage worldwide.
Yep O-O, Comic Sans. What the fu-

Many of these trends originated because search engines were bad. Really bad. So people linked their websites by entering on Webrings and by sharing Buttons with their friends. Buttons are like souvenirs from websites. These can be put on other's websites to show they liked the website, or that they're friends of their corresponding webmaster.
