# Brief history of web development in the early 1990s-2000s

If you're reading this book, I assume you're a nostalgic peep who also wants to build a website reminiscent of the 90s. However, you may have discovered that it's challenging to create one. That's why I'm here to help you. :D

There were many trends back in the 90s, such as having your visitors sign a guestbook, visitor counters, and blinkies/buttons(More on that later), and believe it or not, <span style="color: green; font-family: 'Comic Sans', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">Comic Sans</span> was all the rage worldwide.
Yep O-O, Comic Sans. What the fu-

Many of these trends originated because search engines were bad. Really bad. So people linked their websites by entering on Webrings and by sharing Buttons with their friends. Buttons are like souvenirs from websites. These can be put on other's websites to show they liked the website, or that they're friends of their corresponding webmaster. 
We'll also talk about how to create a button yourself in this book. 

In this book, I will teach you how to build your own website from scratch, what were the trends in the 1990s-2000s and how can we replicate the looks of such websites.
Without further ado, let's start!
