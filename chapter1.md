# Chapter 1: The basics

## What is a website
Nowadays we all know what a website is. You probably browse them daily, via Google Chrome or any other browser. Imagine them as small chunks of land with houses on it. The land is their domain name and the house it's content. Every house is made from a variety of rooms, the web pages. All together is sitting on a chunk of land, a web server. 
What's even cooler is that websites can server various purposes. From selling books to reading the news, every website is made for a certain purpose.
Quoting the Wikipedia;

> A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.

You can see there is a *connection* between the *web server* and the *client*. A web server is a machine *serving*(Sending the files) files to the *client*. The *client* is the web browser the user uses to browse the web through via a terminal such as a PC or a phone.  

A web browser is a piece of software that enables you to navigate through websites. It retrieves the HTML code from any Web Server and it displays the website on the client following a set of standards that all browsers share.

Now that we know what a website is, let's dive further on how they work.
