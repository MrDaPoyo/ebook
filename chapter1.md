# Chapter 1: VScode and Web Development Tools

In this chapter, we will explore the powerful combination of Visual Studio Code (VScode) and various web development tools that will be very useful! 
## 1.1.1 Getting Started with VScode

VScode is a popular code editor developed by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of features and extensions that make it a favorite among many web developers. To get started with VScode\footnote{Official video-guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk}, it's as simple as visiting their official website\footnote{You can get VScode from https://code.visualstudio.com/.} and downloading VScode. Afterwards, make sure to run the installation wizard and you're now good to go!

## 1.1.2 Essential Extensions for Web Development

VScode offers a huge collection of extensions that enhance the web development experience. Here are some essential extensions to consider:

1. **HTML CSS Support**: Provides autocompletion and syntax highlighting for HTML and CSS.
2. **Live Server**: Launches a local development server and automatically refreshes the browser whenever you make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files. I personally love this extension because it makes web development so easy, that I can finish websites in a matter of minutes.
3. **Prettier**: Prettier automatically formats your code to ensure consistent styling and readability.
4. **Rainbow Indent**: It helps a lot with indenting and if you indent correctly, it will display a rainbow! :) Cool, isn't it?
5. **Live Share**: This extension allows you to share your local machine with your peers, so you can work collaboratively in a single dev environment! You can be editing one file while your peer edits another one. It's a must-have extension in my opinion.

## 1.1.3 Collaboration and Remote Development

VScode enables seamless collaboration and remote development. Here are some features to consider:

1. **Live Share**: With Live Share, you can share your development environment with others, allowing them to edit and debug code in real-time.
2. **GitHub Codespaces**: GitHub offers a service called Codespaces, which provides a cloud-based development environment with VSCode pre-installed. With Codespaces, you can access a Linux machine from anywhere in the world, making it convenient for remote development.

# 1.1.4 How to use VSCode?
1. **Opening a Project**: Once you have installed VSCode, open it and you will see the welcome screen. From there, you can either open an existing project or create a new one. To open an existing project, click on "Open Folder" and select the folder containing your project files.
2. **Editor Layout**: The VSCode interface consists of several components. The main area is the editor, where you write your code. On the left side, you have the sidebar, which provides access to different views like the file explorer, source control, extensions, and more. At the bottom, you have the status bar, which displays information about the current file and provides quick access to various settings.
3. **Terminal**: VScode has an integrated terminal to make coding easier. You can access it by opening the bottom bar. But be careful! It will be a live terminal running on your computer. I suggest doing all of your changes in a single folder and then, once you're finished, move all of the files inside to the location where you'll be running them.

# 1.2 Git
## 1.2.1 What is Git?

Git is a widely used version control system. It's useful for having and mantaining different versions of your code, and to store them in GitHub for free. Thankfully, VScode offers excellent integration with Git. Let's see how can we use it!

## How to use git?
Git is a command line tool. That means it can be accessed and used via the terminal. The main Git commands are:

- `git init` Create a new repository
- `git clone <repository url>` Download a copy of a repository to commit changes or just to use the code.

In this chapter, we explored the power of VScode and various web development tools. We learned how to get started with VScode, essential extensions for web development, debugging and testing capabilities, version control with Git, and collaboration features. In the next chapter, we will learn about the basics of building websites. See you there!
